Tyler Saadus

Extremely basic program that takes pre-defined chunks of a song and re-arranges them randomly into an output song. Could be made much more user friendly, but this functions for now.
Currently formatted for Traffickers by The Reflecting Skin.

Building
--------
Simply run make.
Requires the [libsndfile](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/) library to be installed to compile.
